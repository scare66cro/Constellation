# LP-AM2434 — Custom Stage-2 SBL + A/B Bank Rollback (F2c)

> **Status:** Session 1 (Pi5/app-side wiring) COMPLETE 2026-05-30 at
> fw 0.A.208. Session 2 (custom `sbl_chooser` fork + JTAG-flash to
> `0x000000`) is the next bench session. Session 3 is unblocked.
>
> **Goal:** unattended OTA recovery. A bad Bank-B image cannot
> permanently brick a customer panel — after three failed boots the
> SBL falls back to Bank A (or Golden if both are broken). Combined
> with the dual-core watchdog (F3, fw 0.A.59) and Phase 4 OTA
> (validated end-to-end 2026-05-29 on the 4-board fleet at 0.A.208),
> this gives true field-deployable updates with no JTAG service trip.

## 1. Why this matters now

Phase 4 OTA is **validated** — yesterday's run reached
`overallState: "done"` on all 4 boards (.1 CONTROLLER self-update +
.2/.3/.4 orbits), and `.1 active=bankB banks=AB` proves the
controller-self-update Activate completed cleanly. But there is still
**one hard-brick path**: if power fails between the SBL erase of
Bank A's old image and the new image landing, the LP boots into a
partially-written bank with no rollback. Today's recovery is a JTAG
trip.

F2c closes that path. After F2c:
- Power loss mid-OTA → next boot detects the failed bank, falls back
- Three consecutive failed boots of a newly-activated image → SBL
  auto-rolls to the previous bank
- Both A and B unusable → SBL boots the factory Golden image

No JTAG required. This is the threshold between "bench-validated OTA"
and "field-deployable OTA."

---

## 2. Boot stack today vs after F2c

| Today (0.A.208) | After F2c |
|---|---|
| ROM (stage 1) → TI stock `sbl_ospi` (stage 2, hardloads `0x080000`) → Nova app | ROM → **forked `sbl_chooser`** (stage 2, reads FwBankHeader → picks A/B/Golden by sequence + strikes) → Nova app |

The "stage 2" we're replacing is TI's `sbl_ospi` example — a NoRTOS
R5FSS0_0 image (~311 KB signed) that lives at flash offset `0x000000`
and loads an MCELF from a hard-coded offset (`0x080000`). We fork it
once into `Nova_Firmware/lp_am2434/sbl_chooser/` and never touch it
again.

---

## 3. Current OSPI map (W25Q128JV, 16 MB — fw 0.A.208 authoritative)

The "canonical map" in the original 0.A.59 version of this doc is
**stale**; what actually shipped through Phase-C bringup, Phase 1
OTA, the 0.A.102 4-byte addressing escape, and yesterday's 0.A.208
SBL-preserve relocation is the table below. The authoritative values
live as `FW_*` macros in `Nova_Firmware/Platform/nova_fw_update.h`;
this table is the quick-reference summary.

| Offset | Size | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x000000` – `0x05FFFF` | 384 KB | TI stock `sbl_ospi` (today) → **custom `sbl_chooser`** (after F2c) | TI's stock is ~311 KB; tail extends to ~`0x4BE2D`. F2c chooser fits in the same envelope. |
| `0x080000` – `0x1FFFFF` | 1.5 MB | **Bank A app image** (mcelf.hs_fs) | Same offset TI's stock SBL hardloads → migration-free first flash of F2c (existing app stays where it is). |
| `0x180000` – `0x1FFFFF` | 512 KB | Watchdog R5FSS1_0 mcelf (overlaps end of Bank A footprint by design) | App images stay well under 1 MB so no real conflict. |
| `0x300000` – `0x33FFFF` | 256 KB | **FwBootMeta + Bank A FwBankHeader + Bank B FwBankHeader** | Relocated 2026-05-29 in 0.A.208 from `0x060000` to escape the SBL footprint. The old location wiped the SBL tail on every metadata update — see [`memories/repo/sbl-wipe-controller-self-update-7th-layer-2026-05-29.md`](../memories/repo/sbl-wipe-controller-self-update-7th-layer-2026-05-29.md) for the 7-layer saga. |
| `0x340000` – `0x4FFFFF` | 1.75 MB | Reserved (post-relocation slack) | Future per-bank manifests, signed dependency graphs, etc. |
| `0x500000` – `0x5FFFFF` | 1 MB | Reserved | Future log buffers / asset files. |
| `0x600000` – `0x61FFFF` | 128 KB | `lp_device_config` ping-pong banks | Per-board role/IP/MAC. Migrated here May 2026. |
| `0x620000` – `0x7FFFFF` | ~2 MB | `LpSettings` vault (future) | Currently MSRAM-only. |
| `0x900000` – `0xA7FFFF` | 1.5 MB | **Bank B app image** (mcelf.hs_fs) | Relocated 2026-05-15 in 0.A.102 from `0x200000` to force 4-byte addressing (variant-D probe). `0x200000` failed 0.A.78-82, `0x400000` failed 0.A.83+; both were inside the 16 MB 3-byte address region. `0x900000` is well into 4-byte-only territory. |
| `0xC00000` – `0xD7FFFF` | 1.5 MB | **Golden recovery image** | Manufacturing-flashed, read-mostly. SBL falls back here if both A and B fail validation. |

### Why these offsets — historical:

- **`0x300000` metadata block (0.A.208):** the original
  `0x060000` location landed inside the 256-KB erase block that
  contains TI's stock SBL tail. `write_meta_block_atomic` erases that
  block on every metadata update, wiping the SBL tail to 0xFF; next
  warm-reset → ROM rejects the truncated SBL and falls into BOOT ROM.
  Nova OFFLINE forever. New location at `0x300000-0x33FFFF` overlaps
  nothing and lives in the reserved region.
- **`0x900000` Bank B (0.A.102):** OSPI addressing mode tripwire.
  AM2434's OSPI controller has separate code paths for 3-byte
  (`< 0x1000000`) and 4-byte (`>= 0x1000000`) addressing on some
  Cypress S25HL variants. The 3-byte path silently dropped page
  writes past sub-PP boundaries (see invariant #11). `0x900000` is
  beyond the 8 MB mark and forces 4-byte mode unconditionally.
- **`0x080000` Bank A stays put:** matching TI's stock SBL hardload
  offset means F2c first-flash needs no app re-flash. Boards already
  in the field get an SBL replacement only; their existing app at
  `0x080000` boots normally with the new chooser.

---

## 4. Bank selection algorithm (executed by `sbl_chooser`)

Same as the original design; the algorithm is unchanged from 0.A.59:

```
1. Read FwBootMeta from FW_HEADER_OFFSET (0x300000).
2. Read FwBankHeader[A] from FW_HEADER_OFFSET + FW_BANK_A_HDR_OFFSET (+0x80).
3. Read FwBankHeader[B] from FW_BANK_B_HDR_SECTOR (0x310000).
4. Increment boot_count.
5. Increment watchdog_strikes (cleared by app once "healthy" — see §5).
6. Build candidates list, sorted by (sequence DESC, valid DESC):
     A if A.magic == FW_BANK_MAGIC AND A.valid AND A.crc matches
     B if B.magic == FW_BANK_MAGIC AND B.valid AND B.crc matches
     GOLDEN unconditionally
7. For each candidate:
     If watchdog_strikes >= 3 AND this is the highest-sequence bank:
       skip — previous boot bricked, don't try again.
       Log boot_reason = FALLBACK.
     Try to parse the mcelf at this candidate's bank offset.
     On success: jump (and the app clears strikes within 30 s via
     NovaFwUpdate_ConfirmBoot).
     On failure: continue to next candidate.
8. If no candidate boots: spin in SBL with [SBL] FATAL on UART.
```

`Nova_Firmware/Platform/nova_fw_update.c::NovaFwUpdate_BootValidation`
already implements step 4 + 5 (lines 699-730) and is intended to be
called from the SBL chooser — the function ports cleanly from FreeRTOS
to NoRTOS bare metal because it touches only static variables and
the OSPI driver (which the SBL also uses for boot image read).

**Atomicity of the strike write:** SBL writes `FwBootMeta` BEFORE
loading the app image. If power fails between strike-write and
bank-jump, next boot sees the higher count and proceeds normally —
worst case is one extra strike accounted to a fault that wasn't a
real hang. Acceptable.

---

## 5. Healthy milestone (= "the new image works")

Wired by the watchdog heartbeat task in
[`Nova_Firmware/lp_am2434/lp_watchdog_client.c`](../Nova_Firmware/lp_am2434/lp_watchdog_client.c)
as of 2026-05-30 (Session 1):

| Bit | Source |
|---|---|
| `LP_WD_ALIVE_MODBUS` | `orbit_modbus_tcp.c` accept-loop ping |
| `LP_WD_ALIVE_SYSTEMSTATUS` | main.c data_exchange tick |
| `LP_WD_ALIVE_LWIP_LINK` | `netif_default->flags & NETIF_FLAG_LINK_UP` |
| `LP_WD_ALIVE_ENGINE_TICK` | `lp_engine_tick()` exit |
| `LP_WD_ALIVE_WD_PEER` | watchdog core's `wd_counter` advanced in last 2 s |

**Threshold:** all bits in `LP_WD_REQUIRED_DEFAULT` must hold
continuously for `LP_WD_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD_MS = 30000` ms. Any single
tick dip resets the timer. Once 30 s of sustained all-alive elapses,
`lp_watchdog_heartbeat_task` calls `NovaFwUpdate_ConfirmBoot()` once
per boot. `ConfirmBoot` is **idempotent** (returns early if strikes
are already 0) and gated by `s_ota_confirmed` so we don't repeat the
OSPI read after the first hit — no flash wear on healthy boots.

If the new firmware is broken in a way that prevents reaching healthy
within 30 s × 3 boots, the SBL chooser falls back automatically.

---

## 6. Diagnostic surface (Session 1)

`FwBankInfo` proto (envelope tag 115) now exposes the F2c state so
the UI version page can show it without needing JTAG:

```proto
message FwBankInfo {
  FwBankId active_bank     = 1;
  string   bank_a_version  = 2;
  uint32   bank_a_crc      = 3;
  bool     bank_a_valid    = 4;
  string   bank_b_version  = 5;
  uint32   bank_b_crc      = 6;
  bool     bank_b_valid    = 7;
  string   golden_version  = 8;
  uint32   boot_count      = 9;
  uint32   boot_reason     = 10;
  uint32   current_role    = 11;  // (Gap 1, 2026-05-20)
  uint32   watchdog_strikes = 12; // (F2c S1, 2026-05-30) NEW
}
```

The bridge decoder in
[`constellation-ui/server/src/novaFwUpdateManager.ts`](../constellation-ui/server/src/novaFwUpdateManager.ts)
unpacks both new fields. Health-row line on the bridge console now
reads `boots=N, strikes=M` so a quick `journalctl -u agristar-bridge`
shows the F2c state for any board emitting FwBankInfo.

---

## 7. Migration plan (existing-board safe)

The bench has 4 LP boards already provisioned with TI's stock SBL +
fw 0.A.208 at `0x080000`. The migration to F2c needs to be lossless —
no required JTAG re-flash dance.

Per board, in this order:

1. **Already done in 0.A.208:** app at `0x080000` runs the
   `nova_fw_update.c` codepath (Session 1 just wired the missing
   ConfirmBoot heartbeat hook). The LP emits the F2c diagnostic
   field via FwBankInfo. No bench-side regression risk.
2. **JTAG-flash custom `sbl_chooser` to `0x000000`.** Replaces TI's
   stock SBL. The app at `0x080000` stays put.
3. **JTAG-write FwBootMeta + Bank-A FwBankHeader at `0x300000`.**
   Set sequence=1, magic=NOVA, valid=1, image_size and crc computed
   from the existing image at `0x080000`. After this, the SBL
   chooser will boot the existing app on the next reset.
4. **Reset and verify.** Boot trace shows
   `[SBL] bank=A seq=1 strikes=1` (the 1 is normal — clears within
   30 s when the app reports healthy via the heartbeat hook landed
   in Session 1).
5. **First OTA push then writes Bank B at `0x900000`** with
   sequence=2. Subsequent updates ping-pong between A and B.

**Recovery path if `sbl_chooser` itself is broken:** flash TI's stock
`sbl_ospi` back to `0x000000` via the existing `Flash-LP.ps1` path.
The app at `0x080000` is untouched and boots normally without bank
metadata.

## 8. What's done (Session 1) vs what's next

### ✅ Session 1 — DONE 2026-05-30 (this session)

| Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Update `FW_*` offsets to current map | ✅ already at 0.A.208 values | `nova_fw_update.h` |
| Refresh `nova_fw_update.h` docblock | ✅ rewritten to current layout | `nova_fw_update.h` lines 1-27 |
| Link `nova_fw_update.c` + `hal_flash.c` into LP build | ✅ already linked (0.A.208 ships with both) | confirmed via `.obj` artifacts |
| Call `NovaFwUpdate_Init()` after `LpDeviceConfig_Init()` | ✅ already at `main.c:2199` | n/a |
| Wire `NovaFwUpdate_ConfirmBoot()` from watchdog heartbeat after 30 s | ✅ NEW — added to `lp_watchdog_heartbeat_task` | `lp_watchdog_client.c` |
| Expose `FwBootMeta.watchdog_strikes` to bridge | ✅ NEW — proto field 12, encoder, decoder | `firmware.proto`, `lp_ota_task.c`, `novaFwUpdateManager.ts` |

All Session 1 work is reversible — none of it changes what's flashed
at any specific OSPI offset. If the heartbeat hook misbehaves, just
revert `lp_watchdog_client.c`; OSPI is untouched. The diagnostic
proto field is purely additive (older bridges/firmwares ignore it).

### Session 2 — `sbl_chooser` fork (next bench session)

- Copy TI's `sbl_ospi_multi_partition` example into
  `Nova_Firmware/lp_am2434/sbl_chooser/`.
- Insert A/B/Golden selection logic into its `main.c`. Port
  `NovaFwUpdate_BootValidation` from `Nova_Firmware/Platform/` to
  NoRTOS bare metal (no FreeRTOS in the SBL).
- Build + sign per TI's standard flow →
  `sbl_chooser.release.tiboot3.bin`.
- JTAG-flash to `0x000000` **on a single bench board only**.
- Verify boot trace, then verify negative test (manually corrupt
  Bank A's CRC, confirm fallback to Golden which we'll have written
  too).

### Session 3 — productionize across the fleet

Once Session 2 has proven the chooser on one board:

- Flash `sbl_chooser` to the other 3 bench boards.
- Add Bank-B headers (write FwBankHeader for `0x900000` once the
  next OTA cycles a real image there).
- Update `Build-Cfu.ps1` to emit the SBL chooser binary alongside the
  app binary so manufactured boards get both.
- Document the new flashing pipeline in
  `docs/firmware-equipment-control.md` and the install runbook.

---

## 9. Risks + open questions

1. **HS_FS device-tree size limit.** TI's stock SBL is 256 KB
   unsigned; the chooser may add ~30 KB. Need to verify HS_FS x509
   cert stays within the device-tree's loadable-region declaration.
   Mitigation: signing tool rejects oversized images at flash time —
   fail-safe.
2. **OSPI DAC mode timing during boot.** `lp_device_config.c` already
   uses indirect read (DAC disabled in syscfg per invariant #11);
   the SBL chooser does the same. No DAC changes; the writes that
   triggered the 3-day DAC-mode debug saga don't apply to read-only
   boot-time header polling.
3. **First-boot strike accounting.** A board fresh from manufacturing
   has `strikes=0`, `boot_count=0`, no bank headers — empty OSPI
   everywhere. SBL must treat this as "JTAG bringup mode" and just
   try to load from `0x080000` (the legacy/bench flow). Detect via
   `magic != FW_BANK_MAGIC` on both bank headers AND
   `boot_count == 0`.
4. **`CMD_REBOOT_SOC` verified working** — used by OTA Activate
   today; SBL sees the warm reset, picks the new bank.
5. **Can we test without bricking?** Yes — JTAG `xdsdfu` can rewrite
   `0x000000` even after a bad SBL flash, because R5F can be loaded
   from CCS into RAM independently. As long as one of the four
   bench boards has a known-good SBL backup we can cross-flash from,
   we always have a recovery path. **Action item before Session 2:**
   image one board's current OSPI sector 0 (TI's stock SBL) to a
   `.bin` archive for quick restore.
